# Productivity Tracker Extension

This project is a work-in-progress browser extension that tracks the time spent on different websites. The extension aims to provide insights into browsing habits by displaying the top visited websites and the time spent on each. It includes a simple and intuitive user interface with an option to expand the list to show all tracked websites.

## Features

- **Time Tracking**: Automatically tracks the time spent on each website.
- **Top 5 Websites**: Displays the top 5 most visited websites with the time spent on each.
- **Expandable List**: Allows users to expand the list to view all tracked websites.
- **Visual Representation**: Includes a linear representation of time spent on each website.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser (like Chrome) to use this extension. No additional software is required.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YZvirblis/Productivity-Tracker-Extension.git
   ```
2. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" by clicking the toggle switch at the top right.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you cloned the repository.

## Usage

- **Viewing Stats**: Click on the extension icon in the toolbar to view the top 5 websites. Click "Show More" to expand the list and see all tracked websites.
